## 1. Core Copy

**H1 (Hero)**  
SEVENTH DAY  
We CREATE brands in seven days.

**Subline**  
In the beginning there was chaos.  
Day one. We began.  
Day seven. The brand is finished.

Six days of work between them.  
No extra meetings. No extra words.

**CTA Button**  
Begin Day One

**Manifesto (About section)**  
We did not invent anything new.  
We simply removed what was not needed.

The usual way: months of talks and revisions.  
Our way: seven days.

Day one — audit.  
Day seven — launch.

That is all.
